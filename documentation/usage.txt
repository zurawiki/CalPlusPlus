Usage Documentation

User Login
We use a Google account for Login. On the welcome page, clicking get started will take the user to the sign in page for Google sign in and authentication.

Calendar Import
Importing calendars is also done through the user’s Google account. On the left hand side of the calendar, click the button that says “Import from Google”

Adding Events
To add an event to the calendar, click the day on which you want the event added. A form will pop-up prompting the user for relevant information.

Importance
The way we designed our calendar, the user is able to classify an event into 3 categories. Normal (not important), Plus (somewhat important), and PlusPlus (very important). The user does this manually on the front end when they are adding events, but the back-end will also have an algorithm that does this through identifying key words.  

Changing Dates
To move an event to a different date, simply drag the event icon from one date to another.

Event Details
To reveal more details about an event, hover over the event icon and a popup will show more information such as the event name, time, etc.

Importance Denotation
Normal events are denoted by a simple circle on the calendar
Plus events are denoted by an outline around the event.
PlusPlus events are denoted by a colored outline around the event.
