Video ScriptWelcome to Cal++, an application that will redefine the way you use calendars. Events of various importance such as Normal, Plus, or PlusPlus are displayed in different ways to make it easy for the user to view their events.Upon entering the site, the user will be greeted with a button that says ‘Get Started’. Clicking this button will take the user to a Google sign-in page, where the user can sign in with their gmail account. After signing in and granting our application access to the account, the user enters the actual calendar page. However, there are no events on the calendar yet. We now need to import events from Google calendar with this blue button the left hand side-bar. Clicking this will import calendar data from the user’s Google calendar into the Cal++ database.If you look at the calendar now, there are 3 main type of icons. The first is a colored circle. This icon denotes events that are of normal importance. The next is an event name that is outlined, which denotes events that are somewhat important. The last is an event name that is both colored and outline, which denotes events are high importance. If you hover over an event, a popup will also appear that reveals more information such as the event name and time.If the user would like to modify events, simply click the event and a form will pop-up allowing you to edit the information. Similarly, if the user would like to add a new event, click the day on which the new event should appear and a similar form will also pop-up.
