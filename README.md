API Keys
---------------

We've registered and included config keys for sandbox applications so that this reference app Just Worksâ„¢,
but you will want to register your own API keys on various services for use in a production app.

API keys and secrets go in *config/oauth.yml* and are loaded and configured in *config/initializers/omniauth.rb*

Getting Started
---------------

To setup the app:

    gem install bundler
    bundle install
    bundle exec rake db:setup
    bundle exec rails server

Then visit /auth/:provider URL to authenticate, like:

<http://localhost:3000/auth/tumblr>
